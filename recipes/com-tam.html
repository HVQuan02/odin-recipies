  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>For Vietnamese, rice is life! Vietnamese eat rice from breakfast to lunch and dinner, and even dessert, albeit in different forms. Growing up in Vietnam, I do not remember a single day that my family skipped rice. The phrase for having a meal, ăn cơm, translates to "eating rice"—Vietnamese history and food culture revolve around it.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Broken Rice</li>
    <li>Grilled Pork</li>
    <li>Shredded Pork and Pork Skin</li>
    <li>Steamed Pork-and-Egg Meatloaf</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Blend lemongrass, garlic, pepper, honey, spring onion, fish sauce, and five spice powder into a chunky marinade.</li>
    <li>Massage the marinade into pork chops and refrigerate for at least 2 hours (or overnight).</li>
    <li>Prepare pickled vegetables by mixing sugar, warm water, and vinegar, then soak julienne carrot and daikon.</li>
    <li>Cook rice (either in a rice cooker or via absorption method).</li>
    <li>Brush pork chops with oil and grill until golden and crispy.</li>
    <li>Make spring onion oil by mixing finely chopped spring onions, salt, and oil.</li>
  </ol>
