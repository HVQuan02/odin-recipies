  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>If you're wondering “What is <b>Pho</b>?” then you're probably also wondering “Why is she so bonkers over it???” I don't blame you. It looks like a relatively harmless bowl of beef noodle soup. That is, until you take your first slurp. The Pho soup broth is <strong style="text-transform:uppercase">everything</strong>. It's light yet full of flavour, deceptively beefy, savoury, complex, has the tiniest hint of richness and is filled with beautiful spices like cinnamon. It is, without question, one of <em>The Best Soups</em> in the whole world!</p>
